# CPME255--Data-Mining 

Explore Colabs, Python, and AI pair programming by utilizing platforms like Akkio.com or other no-code AI platforms for machine learning projects.

Assignment 1:

Watch the two Colab demo videos discussed in class.
Implement all the code from Derek Banas’ Python tutorial in Colab, run it, and present the results.
Implement the features from the advanced Colab tutorials in the provided slides and integrate them into a Colab.
I have successfully implemented all the code shown in Derek Banas’ video and the advanced Colab tutorials, and I have uploaded the results.




Assignment3: Auto ML with akkio or jadbio or any other good zero code automl - trial version Get akkio.com freeaccount, demonstrate one (or more if you are interested) end2end ml project in jadbio (no code project)
Here is my video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow0peMjMSCg 

For the Sales Forecasting project in Akkio, gather a dataset with columns like date, sales amount, region, and product category. Upload the data, select "Sales Amount" as the target variable, and let Akkio automatically train the model. After training, evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and R². Once the model is accurate, deploy it to predict future sales. You can refine the model by adding features like marketing spend or promotions for better accuracy.
Akkio.com provides:
